Here’s a no-nonsense design for the “basketball = many paths, classical path survives” tab. It’s built to be coded in the browser (Canvas/WebGL/p5.js). Math is light but sufficient to drive convincing visuals.

What the user sees

Canvas (left): court-style 2D scene. A start point (shooter) at (x_0,y_0) and a hoop (target) at (x_1,y_1).
Controls (right/top):
	•	Path mode: Spray | Neighborhood | Parameter heatmap
	•	Samples: (N) number of candidate paths
	•	Total time T: slider (fixed endpoints, fixed duration — Hamilton’s principle setting)
	•	“Effective ħ” slider (phase scaling): from “very small” (classical) to “larger” (quantum-y toy)
	•	Toggles: Show S labels, Show phasors, Show classical path, Gravity g, Air drag (toy)

Status panel (bottom):
	•	Argmin S path value (highlighted)
	•	Vector sum magnitude |\sum e^{iS/\hbar_\text{eff}}| (shows how much “everything but classical cancels”)
	•	Snippets: action S histogram, and phase wheel

Visual behavior by mode

1) Spray (all kinds of paths)
	•	The app generates lots of candidate paths from start to hoop (curvy, loopy, zig-zag).
	•	Each path is drawn as a polyline (or cubic Bézier) in semi-transparent strokes.
	•	Color encodes action S (e.g., cooler = lower S, warmer = higher S). The lowest-S path glows.
	•	If phasors are ON, each path also has a little arrow next to it whose angle is \phi = S/\hbar_\text{eff}. You also see a tip-to-tail vector sum: paths near the minimum point roughly the same way (add), the rest spin around the circle (cancel).

Result the student intuits: there are infinitely many ways a ball “could” go, but when you sum their contributions, only a small neighborhood around one shape survives → the parabola.

2) Neighborhood (wiggles around the classical)
	•	The classical projectile (parabola) is shown in bold. Then generate paths by small random perturbations of that curve (jitter control points).
	•	Draw only these near-by variations and their phasors. Now the difference is stark:
	•	Very tiny wiggles → phasors almost aligned (constructive).
	•	Bigger wiggles → phases rotate faster → cancel.
	•	Show the phasor polygon: as you add paths ordered by deviation, the head of the vector sum rapidly spirals into a stable tip — the classical path’s neighborhood dominates.

Result the student intuits: stationary phase: around the true path, S changes slowly → phases align; away from it, S changes fast → phases smear out.

3) Parameter heatmap (feel the “valley”)
	•	Parameterize a family of paths by two numbers (e.g., two Bézier control-point heights p,q).
	•	Sweep a grid in (p,q). For each, compute S(p,q).
	•	Render a heatmap of S (dark = low). Overplot a gradient-descent arrow to the minimum.
	•	Clicking a cell shows that particular path, its S, and its phasor.

Result the student intuits: the classical path sits in a basin of the action landscape.

The physics you actually use (compact but honest)
	•	We’re illustrating Hamilton’s principle: fixed start (x_0,y_0), fixed end (x_1,y_1), fixed duration T. The classical path extremizes
S = \int_0^T \left(\tfrac12 m\,\|\dot{\mathbf r}\|^2 - m g y\right)\,dt .
	•	Discretization for any candidate path:
	•	Represent a path by N points \{\mathbf r_k=(x_k,y_k)\}_{k=0}^{N}, with \mathbf r_0\!=\!(x_0,y_0), \mathbf r_N\!=\!(x_1,y_1).
	•	Uniform time step \Delta t=T/N. Velocity on segment k: \mathbf v_k \approx (\mathbf r_{k+1}-\mathbf r_k)/\Delta t.
	•	Per-segment Lagrangian: L_k = \tfrac12 m \|\mathbf v_k\|^2 - m g\, \bar y_k with \bar y_k=(y_k+y_{k+1})/2.
	•	Action sum: S \approx \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} L_k\,\Delta t.
	•	Phase arrow for each path: e^{iS/\hbar_\text{eff}}. We use an adjustable \hbar_\text{eff} (a teaching knob) because real \hbar would spin phases insanely for macroscopic m. Small \hbar_\text{eff} → sharp classical dominance; larger → more fuzzy (bridges to the quantum tab).

This is exactly the logic Feynman used: in the macroscopic limit, phases from non-stationary paths vary wildly and cancel; only paths near stationary S add.

How to generate paths (robust & fast)

A) Cubic Bézier with fixed endpoints (good default)
	•	Endpoints set at shooter and rim.
	•	Two control points \mathbf c_1, \mathbf c_2 define curvature.
	•	Spray mode: sample \mathbf c_1, \mathbf c_2 from broad distributions (x between endpoints, y in a reasonable band). Reject self-intersecting or crazy-long paths with a max length threshold.
	•	Neighborhood mode: start from control points that yield the true parabola (precomputed once by fitting) and add small Gaussian noise.

B) Polyline jitter (even simpler)
	•	Start from the classical polyline (sampling the parabola).
	•	Add smooth noise (e.g., 1–2 octave Perlin noise) to y-samples, with endpoints clamped.

Either way, re-sample the resulting curve to uniform time steps for a clean S sum.

Computing / showing the “classical” path

You have two clean options:
	1.	Analytic projectile (no drag): choose an initial speed that hits the hoop at some T; draw the parabola (physics-faithful).
	2.	Action minimizer: starting from a random Bézier, run a few steps of gradient descent on (\mathbf c_1,\mathbf c_2) to reduce S (using numerical gradients). The minimizer lands near the parabola; use that as the “classical” reference. (Pedagogically nice because it is minimizing S.)

Show both with a toggle if you want.

⸻

UI/UX micro-interactions
	•	Hover a path: show its S, average speed, peak height, and a little phase wheel.
	•	Click a path: pin it; its phasor is highlighted in the vector-sum plot.
	•	Effective ħ slider: as you lower \hbar_\text{eff}, watch the vector sum tighten onto the classical neighborhood → “macro = classical.”
	•	Time T slider: moving T re-ranks paths. (You’ll see that for very short or very long T, the “best” shape bends accordingly.)
	•	Air drag (toy): if toggled, modify L_k to L_k = \tfrac12 m\|\mathbf v_k\|^2 - mgy - \alpha \|\mathbf v_k\| (non-canonical but visually conveys that extra dissipation reshapes the minimum). Keep it off by default.

Pseudocode (drop into VS Code + Copilot to scaffold)

// params
const N = 200;                 // segments
let T = 1.6;                   // total time [s]
let g = 9.8;                   // gravity
let m = 0.6;                   // kg (visual only; scale S)
let hbarEff = 0.1;             // teaching knob

function sampleBezierPaths(mode, count) {
  const paths = [];
  for (let i=0; i<count; i++) {
    const c1 = pickControlPoint(mode, 1);
    const c2 = pickControlPoint(mode, 2);
    const pts = bezierResample(P0, c1, c2, P1, N); // N+1 points, uniform t in [0,1]
    const S = actionOfPath(pts, T, g, m);          // sum L*dt
    const phi = S / hbarEff;
    paths.push({ pts, S, phi, c1, c2 });
  }
  return paths;
}

function actionOfPath(pts, T, g, m) {
  const dt = T / (pts.length - 1);
  let S = 0;
  for (let k=0; k<pts.length-1; k++) {
    const vx = (pts[k+1].x - pts[k].x) / dt;
    const vy = (pts[k+1].y - pts[k].y) / dt;
    const v2 = vx*vx + vy*vy;
    const ybar = 0.5*(pts[k].y + pts[k+1].y);
    const L = 0.5*m*v2 - m*g*ybar;
    S += L*dt;
  }
  return S;
}

function drawPhasorSum(paths) {
  let Re = 0, Im = 0;
  for (const p of paths) {
    Re += Math.cos(p.phi);
    Im += Math.sin(p.phi);
  }
  const mag = Math.hypot(Re, Im);
  // draw vector (Re, Im) and show |sum|
  return mag;
}

Note: This uses fixed T (Hamilton’s principle), which is the correct variational setting for showing stationary action. It’s also perfect for phasor teaching because only the phase S/\hbar_\text{eff} matters for cancellation.

What students actually learn (without being told equations)
	•	There are many kinematically possible paths.
	•	If you associate each with a phase from its “action cost,” the sum cancels almost everywhere except near one special curve.
	•	That special curve is the classical trajectory.
	•	As you make the system “more macroscopic” (lower \hbar_\text{eff}), the dominance of that curve becomes razor-sharp.
	•	This is Feynman’s bridge from quantum to classical: stationary action = classical path via stationary phase.

If you want, I can sketch the exact Bézier control-point heuristics (to bound path shapes cleanly) and a minimal p5.js file structure next.
